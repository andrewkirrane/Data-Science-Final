# Data Science Final

This project is the final project for the COMP 494 special interest Data Science class. The .ipynb file contains all of the steps for data import, pre-processing, analysis and visualization, and finally analytical model building and comparisons. The main libraries used to handle data are pandas, numpy, and pyplot as well as some of the most widely used analytical models including boosting, trees, and regression. The aim for this project was to predict the final sale prices of houses in King County, WA from a 2015 dataset. We implemented 6 different algorithms and found that linear regression with no intercept offered the lowest error in prediction and we were able to determine the most important features of the dataset in terms of these predictions.
